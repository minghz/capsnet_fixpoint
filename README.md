# CapsNet training with affinite transformed MNIST dataset

Based off [naturomics](https://github.com/naturomics/CapsNet-Tensorflow)
implementation of Capsule Networks in Tensorflow.

Added custom modifications to run with the [affnist dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~tijmen/affNIST/)
as mentioned in [Dynamic Routing Between Capsules](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09829) section 5.2
